# Algorithmic Clustering with Crypto

In this project I will be using classification / PCA and K-Means algorithms to generate a report of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped or clustered together. I will then visualize the results. 

I will first prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means. Next I will reduce data dimension using PCA. Then i'll predict clusters using the crypto data using KMeans. Finally i'll create some plots and data tables to visualize the data.
